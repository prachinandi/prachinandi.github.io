      <ul>
        <li> Nature was never unfair. Yet somehow homo sapiens claimed the audacity to decide how other animals should live (some in cages, some on display, some for experimentation, and some destined for slaughter). In fact the real victims of our so called civilisation are the animals. Never understood why we rush to create artificial beings and forget what we owe to the living beings who were here long before us.
        <li> I grew up moving around to different states throughout my childhood to a point that I changed schools every few years sometimes even within the same year. I learned to know people from a distance and never really developed a sense of belonging. Now, its scary to unlearn that, and maybe I never tried hard enough (did I ever even want to?!).
        <li> Education is a privilege never take it for granted. (They say it's the right but I don't really see that being the case).</li>
